# Conditions

The **Photon** module comes with a set of **Conditions** that complement **Game Creator**'s and allows to check if the Player is yours or Player is the Master Client etc. All conditions can be used on any other module and everywhere.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Most of the Actions won't work if you are not connect to the Photon Service unless you have **offline mode** activated.
