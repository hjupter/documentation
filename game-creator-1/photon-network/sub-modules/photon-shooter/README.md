* **Character** and **Player Shooter Network:** A component required to syncronize all shooter actions.

## Setup

Setting up the **Photon Shooter** sub module is a fairly straight forward process after you learn how to use the **Photon module** and **Shooter** module.

### Step 1

The first thing you need is to setup a **Weapon Registry** component and add all the ammo and weapons as needed.

### Step 2

Once this is done the final step is to turn on the "**Sync Shooter"** option in your **Player Character Shooter** or **Character Shooter** components.
