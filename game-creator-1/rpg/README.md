{% hint style="info" %}
**RPG** comes a minimalist skin. You can create your own by duplicating the default one or import one from the store.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
All actions and conditions are compatible with other Game Creator modules, imagine for example giving a **Melee** skill when player buys a sword item using [**Inventory Module**](https://docs.gamecreator.io/inventory/inventory) or rewarding with **Experience** by completing a quest with the [**Quest Module**](https://docs.gamecreator.io/quests/quests)
{% endhint %}

## Setup <a href="#setup" id="setup"></a>

Download the package the Unity Asset Store (soon). You'll first need to have Game Creator installed.

Then, bring up the _Module Manager Window_ and click the RPG's **Enable** button.

{% hint style="danger" %}
This module requires **Game Creator** and won't work without it. Don't attempt to extract the package inside the Plugins/ folder as it will throw some errors.
