# Setup

## Prepare your Project

Before installing the **Fusion** module, you’ll need to either create a new Unity project or open an existing one.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is important to note that [**Game Creator 2**](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/game-creator-2-203069) and [**Fusion**](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/photon-fusion-267958) should be present before attempting to install this module.
{% endhint %}

## Install the Fusion module

If you haven't purchased the [**Fusion**](https://u3d.as/2Cws) module, head to the Asset Store product page and follow the steps to get a copy of this module.

Once you have bought it, click on **Window → Package Manager** to reveal a window with all your available assets.

Type in the little search field the name of this package and it will prompt you to download and install the latest stable version. Follow the steps and wait till Unity finishes compiling your project.



## Examples

We highly recommend checking the examples that come with the **Fusin** module. To install them, click on the _Game Creator_ dropdown from the top toolbar and then the _Install_ option.

The **Installer** window will appear and you'll be able to manage all examples and template assets you have in your project.

* **Examples**: A collection of scenes with different use-case scenarios
* **UI**: A bundle of common user interface elements

{% endhint %}

Once you have the examples installed, click on the _Select_ button or navigate to `Plugins/GameCreator/Installs/Fusion.Examples/`.

## Getting Started

This module requires Fusion to be installed first. After you have imported Fusion you need to set-it up and create your App Id in order for this to work.

You can follow this getting started [**guide from Fusion**](https://doc.photonengine.com/fusion/current/tutorials/shared-mode-basics/1-getting-started)
