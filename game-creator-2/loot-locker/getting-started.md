# Getting Started

### 1. Create a Free Account

To create your free LootLocker account, visit the [sign-up page on the LootLocker website](https://lootlocker.com/sign-up). In this form you can provide your name, company name, email address, and set a password. Confirm that you agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, and click Create Free Account.

### 2. Create a New Game

Once you've created and verified your account, you'll next want to create a new game within LootLocker through our [Web Console](https://console.lootlocker.com/). If you've already created a game and want to create a new one, simply click New Game in the My Games panel in your game dashboard.

### 3. Install & Configure the SDK

The SDK can be downloaded through the Unity Asset Store, from the LootLocker Github repository release page, or installed directly using the Unity Package Manager.

* [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/lootlocker-sdk-233183)

### 5. Install the Module

After importing LootLocker module head to the Game Creator Install window and install the Core package.

{% hint style="danger" %}
This module requires [**Game Creator 2**](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/game-creator-2-203069) and won't work without it. Don't attempt to extract the package inside the Plugins/ folder as it will throw some errors.
