<summary>Getting errors after updating Melee 2</summary>

Photon Melee 2 requires some special modifications in Melee 2 scripts, these modifications are made automatically after installing Photon Melee 2 but if you update Melee 2 these update will be overwritten.

To fix this follow these steps

* Uninstall Photon Melee 2
* Wait until script compilation finishes
* Install Photon Melee 2

After this the errors should be gone, if you are still having troubles feel free to reach me at our Discord server
