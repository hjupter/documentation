# Memory

The **Faction Memory** component integrates with the Game Creator 2 Save & Load system to persistently save and load the faction-related data for any object, character, or player. This component ensures that all member joined factions, reputation points, and statuses are retained across game sessions, enhancing the continuity and immersion of your game’s faction system.

{% hint style="success" %}
The Faction Memory component works similarly to other memory components (e.g., Position, Rotation, Scale) within Game Creator 2. By adding this component to an object or character, you enable the game to remember and restore their faction memberships and related data.
