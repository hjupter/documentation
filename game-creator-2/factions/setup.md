# Setup

## Prepare your Project

Before installing the **Factions** module, you’ll need to either create a new Unity project or open an existing one.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is important to note that [**Game Creator 2**](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/game-creator-2-203069) should be present before attempting to install any module.
{% endhint %}

## Install the Factions module

If you haven't purchased the [**Factions**](https://u3d.as/3iwW) module, head to the Asset Store product page and follow the steps to get a copy of this module.

Once you have bought it, click on **Window → Package Manager** to reveal a window with all your available assets.

Type in the little search field the name of this package and it will prompt you to download and install the latest stable version. Follow the steps and wait till Unity finishes compiling your project.
