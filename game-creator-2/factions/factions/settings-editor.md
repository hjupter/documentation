## Faction Settings Editor

The Faction Settings Editor is the central hub for managing all faction relationships and statuses within your game. It provides a comprehensive interface for defining and visualizing how different factions interact with each other.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Faction relationships** in this system are inherently **two-way**, meaning that each faction’s stance towards another can differ.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**For example**, while the “Humans” faction might view the “Orcs” as hostile, the “Orcs” might view the “Humans” as neutral. \
\
This dynamic allows for complex and realistic interactions where each faction independently determines its stance towards every other faction. \
\
The relationships matrix visually represents these two-way dynamics, making it easy to understand and manage the intricate web of inter-faction relationships in your game.

## Faction Statuses

* **Key**: This field allows you to define the name of the faction status, such as Hostile, Neutral, Friendly, or any custom status like Honored.
* **Color**: Each status is associated with a color for easy visualization and differentiation.
* **Points Required**: This defines the reputation points needed for an entity to reach a specific status with a faction.

## Faction Relationships Matrix

The relationships matrix is a visual representation of how each faction perceives the other factions. It uses the defined statuses to show these relationships.

{% hint style="success" %}
Select each circle to modify the relationship status between factions. These adjustments will also be applied to each Faction asset accordingly.
