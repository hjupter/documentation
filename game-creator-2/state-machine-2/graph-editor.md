# Graph Editor

Here is where most of the magic happens!

## The Graph

Here you can create nodes, sticky notes, make groups, drag and drop content.

## The Node Inspector

The node inspector is where you can edit your nodes, once you select a node the inspector will show up. You can select multiple nodes and edit them at the same time.
