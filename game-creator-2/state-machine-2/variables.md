# Variables

There is two new types of Variables that can be used with the State Machine 2.

{% hint style="success" %}
All variables can be created from the State Machine Asset, State Machine Runner or the Blackboard in the Graph Editor
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
They are shared but can hold different values.
{% endhint %}

## State Machine Variables

These are the variables that are created for each State Machine but the values stored in the asset itself, think of this as a regular Global Variable Name.
